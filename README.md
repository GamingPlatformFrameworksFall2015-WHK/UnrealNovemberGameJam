# UnrealNovemberGameJam

This is a base project build for the 2015 November Unreal Engine 4 Game Jam.

The project should be opened by cloning the project directory using an existing Unreal Engine 4.10 build, right-clicking the .uproject file, and generating the project files to create the .sln solution file for use by Visual Studio 2015/2013.
